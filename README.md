# commitstat

A lightweight tool to store metrics and stats directly in your git repo as [git notes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes).

The easiest way to install this for yourself or in CI is with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```console
pipx install git+https://github.com/dropseed/commitstat@git-stats
```

The tool is then available as:

```console
$ git stats
Usage: git-stats [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  clear   Delete all existing stats
  delete  Delete a single stat
  fetch   Fetch stats from remote
  log     Log stats for commits matching git log args
  push    Push stats to remote
  regen   Regenerate stats for all commits matching git log args
  save    Save a stat for a commit
  show    Show stats for a commit
```

Stats are generated by running shell commands.
You can save the names of your stats and their commands in `commitstat.yml`:

```yaml
# commitstat.yml
stats:
  todos:
    run: |
      grep "TODO" -r app -c | awk -F: '{sum+=$NF} END {print sum}'
  num-python-deps:
    run: |
      grep "\[\[package\]\]" poetry.lock -c
  coverage:
    default: 0%
    run: |
      poetry run coverage -m pytest > /dev/null
      poetry run coverage report --data-file .forge/.coverage | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $4}'
```

To generate stats for a commit, run:

```console
git stats save
```

This saves the stats locally, which you could push with `git stats push`.
Typically though you'll run this in CI.

So you can delete your local stats with `git stats delete`,
and then in GitHub Actions, for example, you can do:

```yaml
name: test

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    # ...
    - run: pipx run --spec git+https://github.com/dropseed/commitstat@git-stats git-stats ci

```

## Retroactive stats

You're probably introducing this into an existing project,
and will want to generate some stats for existing commits.

To do that, use:

```console
git stats regen
```

You can specify a key(s) with `git stats regen --key todos`,
and any additional options will be used to select the commits to regenerate stats for (via `git log`).
So, you can regenerate stats for the latest 50 commits with:

```console
git stats regen -n 50
```
